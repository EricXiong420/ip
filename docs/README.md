# User Guide

### A task list you'll want to go back to!

## Features 

### Three different types of tasks

You can add **Todos**, **Deadlines** and **Events** to keep track of those pesky tasks that you know you'll forget in an hour!

You can mark all three done, or undone.

What's more, **Deadlines** and **Events** allow you to include dates, for easy reference!

### Advanced search and filter options

You can easily list out all of the tasks, or filter them by certain keywords, or the date! Neat, isn't it?

### Text-based UI,  with a graphical twist

I know all of you out there love how typing makes all of the tasks really quick and easy to accomplish.

But we're adding that along with a beautiful GUI where a dog named "Hachi" will be handling all of your tasks. Sooo cute.
